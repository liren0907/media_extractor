## Installation

Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. Then clone this repository and build the project:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd media-lake
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

For default operation using settings from `config.json`:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

This will run the mode specified by the `run_mode` field in your configuration file.

### Available Run Modes

Media-Lake supports multiple processing modes:

1. **categorize**: Group similar images together based on visual similarity
2. **benchmark**: Test performance of different matching methods
3. **confusion_matrix**: Generate similarity matrix between images
4. **natural_high_resolution**: Extract highest resolution images by timestamp
5. **natural_high_resolution_split**: Extract highest resolution images of distinct objects by timestamp
6. **compare**: Compare similarity between two specific images

### Running Specific Modes

You can run a specific mode by providing it as a command-line argument:

```bash
# Basic categorization
cargo run categorize [/path/to/source/directory] [/path/to/output/directory]

# Natural high resolution extraction
cargo run natural_high_resolution <directory_path>

# Natural high resolution split (with clustering)
cargo run natural_high_resolution_split <directory_path>

# Compare specific images
cargo run compare <img1> <img2>
```

### Configuration Management

Media-Lake uses a configuration file (`config.json`) to control its behavior:

```bash
# Create default configuration file
cargo run config create

# Show current configuration
cargo run config show
```

## How Image Matching Works

### Enhanced Similarity Algorithm

Media-Lake uses a sophisticated multi-technique approach to image matching:

1. **Perceptual Hash Comparison** (40% weight): Creates a "fingerprint" for each image by:
   - Resizing the image to a configurable hash size (default: 16x16)
   - Converting to grayscale
   - Applying blur to reduce noise (configurable radius)
   - Comparing each pixel to the average to generate a binary hash
   - Calculating the Hamming distance between hashes

2. **Color Hash Comparison** (30% weight): Similar to perceptual hash, but preserves color information for more accurate matching.

3. **Structural Similarity (SSIM)** (30% weight): Evaluates the structural information, luminance, and contrast differences between images for a perceptually accurate comparison.

4. **Bit Error Tolerance**: Allows for more flexibility in matching to handle noisy images.

5. **Near-Threshold Boosting**: Implements special handling for borderline matches to improve categorization.

### Specialized Processing Modes

#### Natural High Resolution

The `natural_high_resolution` mode:
1. Groups images by timestamp (extracted from filenames)
2. For each timestamp group, selects the image with highest resolution
3. Copies selected images to the output directory

#### Natural High Resolution Split

The `natural_high_resolution_split` mode adds intelligence to the selection process:
1. Groups images by timestamp (extracted from filenames)
2. For each timestamp group:
   - Performs similarity-based clustering to identify distinct objects/scenes
   - For each cluster, selects the image with highest resolution
3. Copies all selected images to the output directory
4. Supports multi-threaded processing for improved performance

This mode is particularly useful when multiple distinct objects are photographed at the same timestamp.

### Categorization Process

The categorization algorithm:

1. Scans the specified input directory for supported image formats (jpg, png, gif, bmp, webp)
2. Applies optional filtering (e.g., horizontal-only images)
3. For each unprocessed image:
   - Compares it against all other unprocessed images
   - Groups images with similarity above the threshold (default: 90%)
   - Creates a directory for each category
   - Copies similar images to their corresponding category directory
   - Optionally generates thumbnails

## Configuration Options

### Configuration Parameters Explained

#### Required vs. Optional Parameters

Most configuration parameters have sensible defaults and are optional. The only required parameters are:
- `input_directory`
- `output_directory`

All other parameters will use their default values if omitted from the config file.

#### Directory Settings
- **input_directory**: Path to the source directory containing images to process. Can be relative or absolute.
  - Default: `"data/frames"`
  - Impact: Determines where Media-Lake looks for images to categorize.

- **output_directory**: Path where categorized images and generated data will be stored.
  - Default: `"data/categorized"`
  - Impact: Defines the location for output files, including category folders and thumbnails.

#### Image Processing Settings
- **hash_size**: Size of the perceptual hash in pixels (NxN). Larger values capture more image detail.
  - Default: `8` (8x8 pixels)
  - Current value: `16` (16x16 pixels)
  - Impact: Higher values increase accuracy but reduce tolerance to minor variations and increase processing time.

- **similarity_threshold**: Minimum similarity score (0.0-1.0) required to consider two images as matching.
  - Default: `0.85` (85%)
  - Current value: `0.9` (90%)
  - Impact: Higher values create more categories with fewer images per category, requiring more similarity for grouping.

- **supported_formats**: *(Optional - has default values)*
  - Default: `["jpg", "jpeg", "png", "gif", "bmp", "webp"]`
  - Impact: Determines which file types are included in the processing.
  - Note: This field is now optional in the config file and will use the default values if omitted.

#### Similarity Comparison Settings
- **consider_rotations**: Whether to check for similarities in rotated versions of images.
  - Default: `true`
  - Impact: When enabled, detects similar images even if they're rotated, at the cost of additional processing time.

- **consider_flips**: Whether to check for similarities in horizontally/vertically flipped images.
  - Default: `true`
  - Impact: When enabled, detects similar images even if they're mirrored, at the cost of additional processing time.

- **robust_comparison**: Whether to use higher quality image resizing for more accurate results.
  - Default: `true`
  - Impact: When enabled, uses Lanczos3 filter instead of Triangle filter for more accurate but slower image resizing.

- **use_color_hash**: Whether to incorporate color information in the perceptual hash.
  - Default: `false`
  - Current value: `true`
  - Impact: When enabled, compares colors in addition to patterns, making the comparison more accurate for color-sensitive content.

- **matching_method**: Algorithm used for image comparison.
  - Options: `"perceptualhash"`, `"colorhash"`, `"sift"`, `"surf"`, `"ssim"`
  - Default: `"perceptualhash"`
  - Current value: `"ssim"` (Structural Similarity Index)
  - Impact: Different methods offer varying trade-offs between accuracy, speed, and noise tolerance.

#### Noise Handling Settings
- **blur_radius**: Strength of Gaussian blur applied to images before comparison.
  - Default: `1.5`
  - Current value: `6.0`
  - Impact: Higher values reduce noise but might obscure fine details. Values around 5-7 work well for noisy images.

- **bit_error_tolerance**: Percentage of hash bits that can differ while still considering images as similar.
  - Default: `0.1` (10%)
  - Current value: `0.45` (45%)
  - Impact: Higher values are more tolerant of noise and variations, but may group dissimilar images.

#### SIFT/SURF Specific Settings (for OpenCV Feature Detection)
- **sift_match_threshold**: Threshold for SIFT/SURF feature matching.
  - Default: `0.6` (60%)
  - Current value: `0.35` (35%)
  - Impact: Lower values are more tolerant of perspective changes and partial matches.

- **sift_feature_count**: Maximum number of features to extract with SIFT/SURF.
  - Default: `0` (use OpenCV default)
  - Current value: `800`
  - Impact: Higher values capture more details but increase processing time.

#### Categorization Settings
- **create_category_thumbnails**: Whether to generate thumbnail images for each category.
  - Default: `false`
  - Current value: `true`
  - Impact: When enabled, creates a thumbnail representation of each category for easier browsing.

- **max_images_per_category**: Maximum number of images to include in a single category.
  - Default: `1000`
  - Impact: Prevents categories from becoming too large, which is useful for large datasets.

- **naming_pattern**: Pattern used for naming category folders.
  - Default: `"category_{index}"`
  - Impact: Determines how category folders are named. `{index}` is replaced with a sequential number.

#### General and Filtering Settings
- **log_level**: Controls the verbosity of application logging.
  - Options: `"error"`, `"warn"`, `"info"`, `"debug"`, `"trace"`
  - Default: `"info"`
  - Impact: Higher verbosity levels (`debug`, `trace`) show more detailed processing information.

- **filter_horizontal_only**: Whether to process only horizontally-oriented images.
  - Default: `false`
  - Current value: `true`
  - Impact: When enabled, vertical/portrait images are skipped during processing.

#### Run Mode Settings
- **run_mode**: Specifies the default processing mode when no command-line argument is provided.
  - Options: `"categorize"`, `"benchmark"`, `"confusion_matrix"`, `"natural_high_resolution"`, `"natural_high_resolution_split"`, `"compare"`
  - Default: `"categorize"`
  - Impact: Determines which processing mode to run when no command is provided.
  - Note: This replaces the older `benchmark_mode` flag which is now deprecated.

    - `image1`, `image2`: Paths to images to compare.

### Optimizing Configuration for Your Needs

- **For noisy or low-quality images**: Increase `blur_radius` (4-8) and `bit_error_tolerance` (0.3-0.5)
- **For high-precision matching**: Increase `hash_size` (16-32) and use `"ssim"` as the matching method
- **For faster processing**: Reduce `hash_size` (4-8) and disable `robust_comparison`
- **For color-sensitive matching**: Enable `use_color_hash` and consider using higher `similarity_threshold`
- **For matching despite perspective changes**: Use SIFT with lower `sift_match_threshold` values
- **For better performance in natural_high_resolution_split**: Enable `use_multi_threading` and set `thread_count` to match your CPU core count

## Advanced Usage

### Tuning Natural High Resolution Split Mode

The `natural_high_resolution_split` mode offers several tuning options:

- **split_similarity_threshold**: Controls how images are clustered.
  - Higher values (0.9+): More strict clustering, creates more clusters with fewer images each.
  - Lower values (0.7-0.8): More lenient clustering, creates fewer clusters with more images each.
  - Default: `0.85` (balanced approach)

- **Multi-threading settings**:
  - `use_multi_threading`: Enable/disable parallel processing.
  - `thread_count`: Number of processing threads (set to CPU core count for optimal performance).

### Horizontal Filtering

The `filter_horizontal_only` setting affects all modes including `natural_high_resolution_split`:

- When enabled, only processes images where width > height
- Speeds up processing by ignoring vertical/portrait images
- Applied during initial image loading to maximize efficiency

## Performance Considerations

- The image comparison has O(n²) complexity where n is the number of images
- Use `--release` flag for significantly better performance
- Larger hash sizes provide more accuracy but slower processing
- SIFT-based matching (when OpenCV is enabled) is more compute-intensive but can be more accurate for certain images
